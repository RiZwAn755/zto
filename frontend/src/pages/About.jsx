                <p>ZTO was started by four friends: Mohammad Farhan (Software Engineer), Ashish Maurya (DevOps Engineer), Mohammad Rizwan (Electronics Engineer), and Saurabh Yadav (IT Engineer). All of them grew up in small towns, so they understood the problems and challenges that students from these areas face. They saw that many talented students were missing out on good opportunities. That's why they decided to create ZTO—to help students like themselves get a fair chance to learn, grow, and succeed.</p>
